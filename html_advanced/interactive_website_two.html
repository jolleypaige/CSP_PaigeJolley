            <h2>What is CSP?</h2>
            <p> Computer science principles is a concurrent enrollment class taken at UCAS. In this class we talked about the hardware and software of a computer. This happened in the basics unit. The next unit went over programming. In that unit we learned how to program in C and python. The unit in which we are currently working on is the internet, where right now we are working on creating our own website using HTML and CSS. The next and final unit we are going to learn about is called today, which introduces cyber security, AI, and many other topics
