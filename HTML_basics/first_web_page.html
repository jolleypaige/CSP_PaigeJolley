            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            As is well known, the topic of climate change commonly gets brought up frequently, but why should we care? Why is it occurring today? The answer to this question is us, humans, people, we are causing all this damage to the Earth because of our greed. The increase of global temperatures is caused by human gas emissions of heat- trapping greenhouse gases. As a result of this, glaciers and continental glaciers are shrinking, making many of the animals living in the arctic vulnerable, threatened, and in some cases endangered. This does not only happen at our poles, but everywhere around the world river and lake ice is breaking up earlier in the year, animal and plant geographic ranges are changing, and plants and trees are blooming sooner. All of these aspects are causing major effects on not just us, but the ecosystems cannot evolve as fast as the gases are increasing.
