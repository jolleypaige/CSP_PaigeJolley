        <h1>Amur Leopards</h1>
        <dt>What Are They?</dt>
    <p>
    Amur Leopard, scientific name of Panthera pardus orientalis. These leopards are an indangered species with 200 or less out in the wild. A fact about them is they can run up to 37 miles an hour. Another thing that is interesting is they can leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically. Another thing that is also quite spectacular is some males stay with females after mating, and in cases help with the young.

    <dt>What Would Happen if They Die Out?</dt>
    <p>
        If the species of Amur Leopards were to die outâ€¦ the population of badgers, sika and roe deer would increase because the consumer of them would not be able to eat the animals. If those organisms increase, they will eat more food, resulting in lower amounts of grass, from the deer, and a decrease in the mice and grub that the badger eats. The ecosystem would not completely collapse, but it will cause disruption the environment and the animals. Amur leopards control the populations in the ecosystem, if there are more deer and badgers than the environment can handle, it will cause many changes.
