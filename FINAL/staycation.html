            Imagine, you being in an environment so flat and open that you can see the curves which the Earth offers us, so desolate that not even single cell organisms can produce, this place is not only in the United States, but in Utah! The Bonneville Salt Flats are one of the world's most beautiful and unique landforms. They are about twelve miles long and five miles wide, about 30,000 acres of hard, white salt on the western edge of the Great Salt Lake Basin. Similar to the Great Salt Lake, the flats are the remnants of Lake Bonneville, which covered over one-third of Utah about 10,000 to 32,000 years ago. The Salt Flats are often open to the public for leisure activities.The beautiful scenery and the vast area is an amazing place to visit alone, with family, or friends. It can even be a learning experience for anyone of any age.

            <p>Canals Near Bonneville Salt Flats are not safe for public recreational
                The photos and videos of the crystal clear blue water went viral and became a popular attraction. But authorities are warning the people to stay away from the majestic canals. They are not designed to be safe for the public, the Bureau of Land Management stated, “The canals are industrial facilities leased to Intrepid Potash for potash mining activities and are not designed or safe for public recreation.” Even though it may look very pretty, it is not safe for civilians to use.
